# MOVIE_SEARCH2

In this task ,I have followed MVVM achitecture (with clean code)

along with following dependencies (some latest Android Jetpack):

1. LiveData & ViewModel
2. Data Binding
3. Retrofit 2 with Gson convertor
4. Recyclerview
5. CardView
6. Glide

Also, I have targeted the minimum API version of 22 as per the requirement. Finally If I missed something or you require explanations for the code please do let me know. I'm happy to implement it.
